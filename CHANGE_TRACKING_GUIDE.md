- Reason: Customer requested this popular drink
- Files to modify: api/addProduct.js (add sample), schemas/product.js (if needed)
- Expected outcome: Mocha appears in product list
```

### Step 2: Make Your Changes
As you work, keep track of:
- Files you modify
- Code you add/remove
- Any errors you encounter
- Solutions you implement

### Step 3: Test Your Changes
Before documenting, make sure:
- Your changes work correctly
- You haven't broken existing functionality
- All tests pass (if available)
- The system behaves as expected

### Step 4: Document Your Changes
Update the changelog with:
- Clear description of what changed
- Reason for the change
- Impact on users
- Any important notes

## üö® Important Notes for Beginners

### 1. Always Document Changes
Even small changes should be documented. You might forget why you made a change later.

### 2. Be Specific
Instead of "Fixed bug", write "Fixed cart total calculation not including add-on prices".

### 3. Include Context
Explain why you made the change, not just what you changed.

### 4. Test Before Documenting
Make sure your changes work before you document them.

### 5. Use Consistent Format
Follow the same format for all your change entries.
